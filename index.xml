      <description>This is my first blog on the site I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly if I will be posting regularly on the blogs. I am sure not many people are eagerly waiting either. However since I used Hugo to create this site I though why not make a tutorial for new users who might want their own website.
Installation I installed hugo on Artix Linux so it was as easy as
&amp;gt; pacman -S hugo You can find hugo on most of the distros and their respective repos.</description>
